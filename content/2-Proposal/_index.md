## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Project Overview

NutriChat is an intelligent nutrition assistant web application that helps users build a healthy diet based on personal needs. The application uses the Claude 3 Haiku AI model through the AWS Bedrock service to analyze nutrition data and provide personalized recommendations based on physical condition, health goals, and eating habits.

The system is deployed entirely on AWS with a modern serverless architecture, optimizing costs, increasing scalability, and reducing operational burden. The architecture adheres to the AWS Well-Architected Framework principles: security, performance, reliability, cost optimization, and operational excellence.

### 1.2 Main Objectives

- Build an automated nutrition consultation system.
- Personalize recommendations based on profile, allergies, and health goals
- Deploy on AWS with high availability and auto-scaling
- Ensure user data security.
- Optimize operational costs.

### 1.3 Achievements

**100% Success** - The project has been deployed with all features working stably:

- **Infrastructure**: AWS resources managed with Terraform
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with JWT, email verification
- **AI Integration**: Claude 3 Haiku with streaming responses
- **Database**: PostgreSQL Multi-AZ with automated backups
- **Frontend**: Vue.js responsive UI on CloudFront CDN
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch with logs, metrics, alerts

**Production URL**: https://d13s9jdjslcf4.cloudfront.net

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 2.1 What'"'"'s the Problem?

#### Current Issues in Nutrition Consultation

**1. High Consultation Costs**
- One-on-one nutrition consultation with experts
- Not everyone can afford the fees
- Long waiting times for appointments (1-2 weeks)

**2. Lack of Personalization**
- Online nutrition information is generic
- Does not consider personal allergies and preferences
- Does not match individual health goals

**3. Difficult to Access 24/7**
- Experts only work during business hours
- No immediate support when needed
- Difficult to track progress continuously

**4. Language and Cultural Barriers**
- Lack of Vietnamese-language consultation
- Does not fit Vietnamese food culture
- Difficult to apply advice from abroad

### 2.2 The Solution

#### NutriChat Solution

**1. AI-Powered Chatbot**

- Uses Claude 3 Haiku - an advanced AI model
- Instant responses, no waiting
- Available 24/7, unlimited consultations
- Low cost: ~$0.002/conversation

**2. Personalization Engine**

- Stores detailed profile: height, weight, goals
- Tracks food allergies
- Considers dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, keto, etc.)
- Adjusts recommendations based on physical activity level

**3. Cloud-Native Architecture**

- Deployed on AWS with high availability
- Auto-scaling based on usage
- Multi-AZ deployment for 99.9% uptime
- Global CDN for fast access speed

**4. Security & Privacy**

- AWS Cognito for authentication
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Encryption at rest and in transit



### 2.3 Benefits and Return on Investment

#### User Benefits

**1. Convenience**
- Access anytime, anywhere
- Instant responses (< 3 seconds)
- Save conversation history for review
- No need to travel, saves time

**2. Personalization**
- Recommendations tailored to personal profile
- Avoid allergenic foods
- Match health goals

**3. Privacy**
- No need for face-to-face meetings
- Data encrypted and secure


#### ROI for Investors

- NutriChat is currently in MVP development phase and has not implemented any paid plans for users. The product is open to the community for free use to gather feedback, evaluate usefulness, and refine the user experience. This phase helps the development team understand real needs, adjust features, and shape an appropriate business model.
- Although there is no revenue at the current time, survey results and user feedback allow for preliminary forecasts about commercialization potential in the future.

**Operating Costs (Estimated)**: $86/month (~$1,032/year) (costs may vary based on actual usage)

**Revenue Model Forecast (at official launch)**:
If the product reaches 1,000 active users after full development, the proposed pricing model could include:
  - Freemium: 70% of users (free to attract community)
  - Basic Plan: 25% of users, estimated ~ $5/month
  - Premium Plan: 5% of users, estimated ~ $15/month

**Long-term Business Benefits**
- Operation Optimization: Using serverless architecture provides flexible costs based on user count, saving more than traditional fixed infrastructure.
- Scalability: Cloud architecture allows scaling and adding advanced features without changing infrastructure.
- Improved User Experience: Reduced downtime and faster AI responses → better user retention, increased likelihood of upgrading to paid plans.
- Reusability: AI platform & nutrition data can expand to many new products (meal plans, coaching, nutrition insights).

### 4.2 Technical Deployment

*Deployment Process*: The project is deployed in 6 phases over 6 weeks to build a complete AI nutrition assistant platform.

- Week 7 – Research & Planning
- Week 8 – Architecture Planning
- Week 9 – Frontend & Backend Development
- Week 10 – Infrastructure & Deployment
- Week 11 – AI & Database Integration
- Week 12 – Testing & Documentation

*Technical Requirements*

System deployment will follow each layer: Networking (VPC, Subnets, VPC Endpoints) → Security (Cognito, IAM, Secrets Manager) → Compute (ECS Fargate) → Load Balancing (ALB, API Gateway) → Storage & Database (S3, RDS PostgreSQL) → AI Integration (Bedrock) → Logging/Monitoring (CloudWatch) → CDN & Optimization (CloudFront).

AI Nutrition Platform: Practical knowledge of CloudFront (distributing Vue.js frontend), S3 (storing static assets), API Gateway (HTTP API with JWT Authorizer), ECS Fargate (running Django backend with 1-4 task auto-scaling), RDS PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ, 20GB), Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku for AI chat), Cognito (managing user authentication), and VPC Endpoints (6 endpoints: Bedrock, Secrets Manager, ECR, CloudWatch, S3). Use Terraform for infrastructure as code management (e.g., VPC endpoints for Bedrock, ECS task definitions, API Gateway routes). Django REST Framework handles business logic and minimizes Lambda dependencies. Vue.js + Vite for fullstack web application with real-time streaming.
